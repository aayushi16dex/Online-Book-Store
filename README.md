# Online-Book-Store

I have created an online book store web application which is easy to use, secure, and provides users with a seamless shopping experience.

Technologies used - MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angular, NodeJs

Platform used: VS Code

Project Description:

On login, an authentication check is performed and it checks if the user trying to access the portal is registered in the database. If yes, then their role is checked. Role: Admin ==> Admin portal is opened Role: Customer ==> Customer portal is opened.

Customer Portal:

  1. Enables users to browse, search, and purchase books online. 
  2. The application typically provides users with a catalog of books that they can browse. 
  3. Users can add books to their shopping cart and proceed to checkout to make a purchase. 
  4. The application should provide various payment options such as credit/debit card, PayPal, or other online payment methods.

Admin Portal:

  1. The admin module of the online book store application enables the administrator to manage the inventory of books in the online store. 
  2. It provides features such as adding, updating and deleting books. 
  3. The module is easy to use and secure.

Run the app by writing: 
  1. nodemon run start: Runs the back-end [Node.js]
  2. ng serve: Runs the front-end of application [Angular]
